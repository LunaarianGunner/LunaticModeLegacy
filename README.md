# LunaticModeLegacy
Content pack for Pixurvival at https://pixurvival.itch.io/pixurvival
## Description
This contentpack (or mod, simply) is now considered a legacy version, as we're making a newer one. This will on ly be updated with bug fixes, balancing, and events. We plan to have the new version, which will not be based on vanilla, unlike this one, released by the end of April at least.
